        <!-- <p class="font-bold">Gaza evacuation warnings from IDF contain many errors, BBC finds</p>
        <span>Evacuation warnings issued by Israel to people in Gaza ahead of attacks have contained a host of significant errors, BBC analysis has revealed.</span>
        <br/>
        <span>Warnings contained contradictory information and sometimes misnamed districts. This made them confusing to Gazans seeking safety.</span>
        <br/>
        <span>Experts say such mistakes could violate Israel's international law obligations.</span>
        <br/>
        <span>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has rejected any assertion the warnings were confusing or contradictory.        </span>
        <br/>
        <span>In a statement, it said the alerts analysed by the BBC were only one element of its "extensive efforts to encourage the evacuation [of] civilians out of harm's way".        </span>
        <span>Experts say such mistakes could violate Israel's international law obligations.</span>
