        <p>How the solar eclipse may affect the brain and bring people together</p>
        <span>The date is 28 May, 585 BC, in what is now present-day Anatolia in Turkey. The Medes, an ancient people from modern-day Iran, and the Lydians – a kingdom from the south of modern-day Turkey – have been fighting for six years. According to the Greek historian Herodotus, the war shows little sign of ending, with neither side making significant progress. It will take a solar eclipse to end the bloodshed.</span>
        <br/>
        <span>"Just as the battle was growing warm, day was of sudden changed into night," Herodotus wrote. "The Medes and Lydians, when they observed the change, ceased fighting, and were alike anxious to have terms of peace agreed on."</span>
        <br/>
        <span>We may not see such a dramatic reaction to the total eclipse passing across North America on 8 April this year, but recent research suggests it may nevertheless have a powerful impact on our psychology – by evoking the emotion of awe.</span>
